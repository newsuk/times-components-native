## Prerequisites

- [Node 10+](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode),
- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html),
- [JDK 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/java-archive-javase8-2177648.html)

For more details read the React Native [documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup).

## Getting Started

1. Install [fontforge](http://fontforge.github.io/en-US/): `brew install fontforge` (See [Fonts section](#fonts))
2. Run `yarn install`
3. Components can be seen running in a storybook:
4. `cd ios && pod install && cd -`
5. `yarn start` and leave it running
6. Run the iOS app using XCode or open the Android project to run on Android.

## Native Apps & TCN

In order to run development servers for native applications, start react-native dev
server via:

`yarn android:native` or `yarn ios:native`

For step by step guide, see the corresponding documentation for [android](./lib/android/README.md) and [iOS](./lib/ios/README.md).

## Testing

There is a mixture of different checks & tests split acrossing linting, typechecking and unit tests.

```
yarn lint
yarn test:all
yarn test:android
yarn test:ios
yarn test:common
```

## Releases

##### Production Releases

The release to production pipeline comes with a _hold_ step on CircleCI for builds running on the `master` branch. Once you bump the version in a PR, merge your PR and trigger the `hold_release_prod` step in the build. This will publish the artifacts, for iOS in the artifacts repo and for Android in JFrog.

##### Beta / Patch Releases

Similar to the production releases, you can triger builds with the `hold_release_beta` step from all branches (apart from `master`) as long as the version in `package.json` is a beta version (includes the word beta). Once the "hold" step is approved, the pipeline will build and push to the beta artifacts repos (different location to prod).

##### Updating the native apps

Once a release is published, you will have to bump the version in the native apps. That would be the `Podfile` for `iOS` and the `build.gradle` file for Android.

## Miscellaneous

### Fonts ⚠️

In order to view the storybook on native, you'll need to fix broken fonts. This
fix is done automatically when running storybook (both web and native), but
requires that [fontforge](http://fontforge.github.io/en-US/) is installed,
otherwise the fix won't be applied and you'll get the classic red error screen
when trying to use a broken font.

### Schema

See [utils package](packages/utils/README.md) on how to update the schema
