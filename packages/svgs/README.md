# SVGs

This package ensures a consistent API for SVGs that are used across Times
Components. The native version provides its own set of components and utilises `ART` from
`react-native`. Components available include `G`, `Path`, `Polygon`, `Rect` and
`Svg`.

## Differences

Opacity behaves differently on native and web SVGs. Native has one `opacity` prop
that affects the opacity on both fill colours and stroke colours.
