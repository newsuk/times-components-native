# Article Label

An article label is similar to an article flag, in that it is attached to a
particular article as a piece of styled textual data. Article label, however,
indicates which section an article is located in (e.g. "NEWS" or "COMMENT", or
sometimes what content an article has (e.g. "VIDEO" or "YOUTUBE").
