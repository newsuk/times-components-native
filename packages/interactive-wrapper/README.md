# Interactive Wrapper

The editorial team's developers have created a number of Interactive widgets for
the site. These slot in via HTML web components. These are not available on
native.

This component wraps the Interactive allowing it to display as part of the React
article and be available for the first time on Native.

This is a fallback option, with Interactives being written natively in future.
