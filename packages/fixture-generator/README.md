# FixtureGenerator

This package is meant to create a single testable location for our fixtures. Enabling us to generate fixture data using schema introspection and graphql gen that is typesafe and reliable.

The aim for this package is to give us a single location for integration tests, showcase and UI tests all to use.

Notes:
* Since Jest depends on javascript, this package needs to be transpiled before running any Jest tests. Make sure to re-transpile after making any changes on this package.

* If new types are added to TPA. Please delete `schema.json` and `types.ts` before running `yarn getSchema` followed by `yarn gentypes`. This is due to an issue with file permissions. `types.ts` is an autogenerated file and should not be changed manually.
