# Icons

The icons package exports specific Times icons, that can be configured with four
options:

- `fillColour` - sets the color inside the object
- `strokeColour` - sets the color of the line drawn around the object
- `height`
- `width`

The icons include `facebook`, `star`, `twitter`, and
`video`.
