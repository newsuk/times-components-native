# Author Profile

This author profile package contains the data provider that fetches the articles
for the article list component to show articles associated with a particular
author. This is distinct from the concept of an author profile page in the pages
package which contains the data provider for the author.

Author profile makes use of the article list package which does most of the
heavy lifting in terms of pagination, error handling, layouts and lazy loading.
This package sets out what the article list page header should look like, and
manages its own tracking.

## Future

There is a consideration to move all providers to the provider package. This is
currently under advisement.

A lot of event handling is currently passed down through numerous components. We
intend to utilise the context package (using
[React Context API](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html)) to manage these
events.
