# Context

Provides context capabilities by utilising React's Context API.

This package should be used to create app-wide shared components, such as themes
or shared callbacks.

(See https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html on when to use context and when to
avoid)

## Future

More theme properties will be added in the future, such as the section colours,
that will be defined by the apps' current navigation state.

Client callbacks that are bridged through NativeModules can utilise contexts.
