# Slice layout

Slice layouts are re-usable templates. A slice layout lays itself out according to a
set of self-defined rules. The slice layout also provides a suggested default
configuration that can be applied to the given components that are to be laid
out within the template - this configuration is provided as a JS API for native. The consumer of
slice layout can opt-in or out of utilising these suggested default configurations

## Future

Template creation could be done using a CLI to create default files in the
accepted architectural format
