# Article Extras

Article extras component to wrap components in the footer of the article page. This includes "Topics", "Related Articles" and "Article Comments". Any other component we want to lazy load on native apps can be added to this package.

This component uses a provider and an "ArticleExtras" query to lazily load these components on page view.
