# Pull Quote

Cited content is shown within an article using the pull quote package. This
simple package show a textual quote on the page, and is mostly configured with
the colours that comprise its elements. The pull quote takes required `content`,
which is the quote itself, and two optional strings called `caption` and
`twitter`, which are typically used to attriute the citation (or quote) to a
person, including their (optional) twitter handle.

The colour prop `quoteColour` handles the colour of the colour of the quotation marks.
